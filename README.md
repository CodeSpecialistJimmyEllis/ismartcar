# ismartcar
smart Car came to northwestern university. They said whoever can make a smart car app that was a profound use case 
of their technology would be given free goggle home minis as well as free access to their developer programs highest
settings for 6 months. I didn’t win but I was able to make an iPad app that locked, unlocked, checked the speed of,
and located on a GPS a 2019 Tesla smart car located outside. I of course didn’t create an innovative use case as I 
was working alone. At the current time of the Hackathon their was no Siri support for the smart car api and I had
planned to create the Siri support but I didn’t have the time. I had to write the node.js react js backend that 
called the api. Then push that to heroic so that the demo could be used on a live device instead of just a simulator.
I then had to call the api again in Xcode to use it as an iPad app while developing in swift. So I used JavaScript
and Swift. I used a swift JSON library I found on the internet because I was having problems the Json data. Then I 
used the swift version of the smart car api. This was Hackathon # 18


the work that i will do that i will finish later is that i will fix the UI
then i will fully program the GPS map.
then i will add the SIRI functionality 

thenill contact smart car and see what they have to say about it. ill use the new siri options added to the latest version of
iOS 12 TO ACHIEVE THIS.
